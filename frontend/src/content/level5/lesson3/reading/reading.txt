Global cultures reflect the diversity of human society. Each culture has its own traditions, language, cuisine, and festivals that celebrate its heritage. Cultural diversity enriches communities and promotes understanding between people of different backgrounds. Language plays a crucial role in communication and preserving cultural identity. Festivals bring people together to celebrate shared values and traditions, fostering a sense of belonging and unity.
