# Grammar: Adjectives

Adjectives are words that describe nouns. They provide more information about a person, place, thing, or idea.

## Structure
- Adjectives usually come before the noun:
  - Example: "She is a **happy** girl."
- They can also come after a linking verb:
  - Example: "The girl is **happy**."

### Usage

  - Qualities: "The **tall** building."
  - Emotions: "He is **excited** about the trip."
  - Colors: "She has a **red** dress."
