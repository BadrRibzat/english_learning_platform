## Writing Task: Describe Your Favorite Shape and Color

Choose your favorite shape and color. Write a short paragraph describing why you like them.

Example:
"My favorite shape is a circle. I like circles because they are round like the sun, and I enjoy drawing circles in my artwork. My favorite color is blue. I think blue is calming and reminds me of the sky on a clear day."
