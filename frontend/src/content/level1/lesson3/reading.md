# A Day at the Amusement Park

Last Saturday, Sarah and her friends went to the amusement park. They were very **excited** to spend the day there. As soon as they arrived, they saw the huge roller coaster and felt a little **nervous**. 

They decided to ride it first. After the ride, they were **happy** and laughing. Next, they tried the bumper cars, which made them feel **excited** again. Sarah's friend, Lisa, felt a bit **bored** while waiting in line, but once they got on the ride, she was **happy** again.

After a long day of fun, they were **tired** but **content**. They talked about their favorite rides on the way home and felt **surprised** at how much fun they had together.
