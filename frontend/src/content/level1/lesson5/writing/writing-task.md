## Writing Task: My Favorite Color

Write a short paragraph about your favorite color. Describe why you like it and objects or things that are this color.

Example:
"My favorite color is blue. Blue reminds me of the sky on a clear day and the calmness it brings. I also like blue because it's the color of the ocean and many beautiful flowers."
