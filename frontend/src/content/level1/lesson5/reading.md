# A Day in the Park

Tomorrow, Sarah and her friends will go to the park. They will meet at 10 AM. Sarah is very excited because they will have a picnic. She will pack sandwiches, fruit, and drinks. 

When they arrive, they will find a nice spot under a big tree. They will play games and enjoy the sunshine. If it rains, they will move to a nearby shelter. 

Sarah hopes the weather will be perfect. She will take lots of pictures to remember the day. Everyone will have a great time together, and they will talk about their favorite moments on the way home.
