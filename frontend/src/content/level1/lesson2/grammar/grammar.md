## Singular vs. Plural Nouns

In this lesson, you will learn about singular and plural nouns.

### Singular Nouns

- Singular nouns refer to one person, place, thing, or idea.
- Example: a book, a car, a friend

### Plural Nouns

- Plural nouns refer to more than one person, place, thing, or idea.
- Example: books, cars, friends

#### Rules for Forming Plurals

1. Add -s to most nouns: book → books, pen → pens
2. Add -es to nouns ending in -s, -x, -z, -ch, -sh: box → boxes, bus → buses
3. Change -y to -ies if a noun ends in a consonant + y: baby → babies
4. Some nouns have irregular plural forms: child → children, mouse → mice
