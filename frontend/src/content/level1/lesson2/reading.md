# A Trip to the City

Last weekend, Tom and his friends decided to visit the city. They are taking the bus to get there. The bus is leaving at 9 AM, and they are excited about the trip. When they arrive, they are planning to visit a famous museum and see the art exhibits.

While they are at the museum, they are taking pictures and learning about the different artworks. After the museum, they are going to a restaurant to eat lunch. They are trying new dishes and enjoying their time together. 

At the end of the day, they are tired but happy. They are talking about their favorite parts of the trip on the bus ride home.
