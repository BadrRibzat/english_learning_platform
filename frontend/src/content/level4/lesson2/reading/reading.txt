There are four seasons in a year, each with its own characteristics. Spring is known for blooming flowers and warmer weather. Summer is the hottest season, perfect for swimming and outdoor activities. Autumn brings cooler temperatures and colorful leaves falling from trees. Winter is cold, with snow covering the ground in many places. The weather can change throughout the day, so itâ€™s important to be prepared for different conditions.
