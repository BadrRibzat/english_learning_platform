# Grammar: Comparatives and Superlatives

Comparatives and superlatives are used to compare differences between the two objects they modify (comparative) and to describe the highest degree of a quality (superlative).

## Structure
- **Comparative:** Subject + verb + adjective + -er + than
  - Example: "This festival is **more exciting** than the last one."
- **Superlative:** Subject + verb + the + adjective + -est
  - Example: "This is the **most popular** festival in the city."

### Usage
- Use comparatives to compare two things:
  - "The music is **louder** than the art."
- Use superlatives to describe one thing as the highest:
  - "This is the **best** restaurant in town."
