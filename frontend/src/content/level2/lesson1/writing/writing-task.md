# Writing Task: My Daily Schedule

Write a short paragraph describing your daily schedule. Include the following details:
- What time you wake up and go to bed.
- Your meal times (breakfast, lunch, dinner).
- Any activities or appointments you have during the day.

Example:
I wake up at 7:00 AM every morning and go to bed around 11:00 PM. For breakfast, I usually have toast and coffee at 7:30 AM. My lunch break is at 12:00 PM, and I usually have a sandwich and salad. In the evening, I enjoy cooking dinner around 6:30 PM. On Tuesdays, I have yoga class at 5:00 PM.
