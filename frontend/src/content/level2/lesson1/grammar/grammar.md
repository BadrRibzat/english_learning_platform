# Grammar: Prepositions of Time

In English, we use different prepositions to talk about time:

- **At**: Used for specific times (e.g., at 3 o'clock, at noon)
- **In**: Used for longer periods of time (e.g., in the morning, in July)
- **On**: Used for specific days or dates (e.g., on Monday, on March 15th)
