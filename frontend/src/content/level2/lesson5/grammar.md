# Grammar: Conditional Sentences

Conditional sentences are used to express that one thing will happen if another thing happens. They often use "if" to introduce the condition.

## Structure
- **Type 1 (Real Present):** If + present simple, will + base form
  - Example: "If you eat well, you will feel better."
- **Type 2 (Unreal Present):** If + past simple, would + base form
  - Example: "If I had more time, I would exercise more."
- **Type 3 (Unreal Past):** If + past perfect, would have + past participle
  - Example: "If I had known, I would have helped."

### Usage
- Use conditional sentences to express possibilities or hypothetical situations:
  - "If it rains, we will stay indoors."
