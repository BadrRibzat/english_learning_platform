# Grammar: Passive Voice

The passive voice is used when the focus is on the action, rather than who or what is performing the action.

## Structure
- **Affirmative:** Subject + form of "to be" + past participle
  - Example: "The book **was read** by the student."
- **Negative:** Subject + form of "to be" + not + past participle
  - Example: "The project **was not completed** on time."
- **Interrogative:** Form of "to be" + subject + past participle?
  - Example: "**Was** the homework **done** by you?"

### Usage
- Use the passive voice to emphasize the action:
  - "The new software **was developed** by the team."
- It is often used in formal writing:
  - "The results **were published** in a scientific journal."
